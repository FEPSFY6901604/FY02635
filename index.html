    This paper presents a novel adaptive active learning strategy, the most accurate classification model from a heterogenous classifier pool is selected at each learning epoch. Our goal is to achieve greater incremental
    improvement in accuracy, compared to using a single type of classification model throughout the process. The stategy is evaluated on benchmark data sets. We further consider an application to texture classification

Over the past 70 years, since the first satellite, Sputnik 1 was launched into orbit, spacecraft has developed drastically in terms of power and technology. While its
development has hugely benefited society due to its research and economic advantages, it has also contributed to environmental issues, for example debris and chemical pollution.

Research development 

One significant benefit to the development of spacecraft in the past 70 years is the growth in human understanding of the universe. For example, since the launch
of the International Space Station (ISS) in November of 1998 <a href="#References">(Wild, 2024)</a> hundreds of key findings have been made. One of which being the discovery of new X-ray
sources in the sky with the use of the Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) <a href="#References">(Guzman, 2024).</a> The MAXI was fitted onto the ISS in order to get a greater view of the
surrounding universe that isn’t visible from the Earth’s surface. Without the use of spacecraft, the advanced discoveries and studies of pulsars and black holes wouldn't
have been possible. This is key in understanding the impacts of society as it further develops our understanding of spacecraft. However, there are also environmental
issues that cause negative impacts in society.  

Environment 

While there are positive effects of space craft, there are also negative effects. Rockets can cause multiple environmental issues, for example chemical and debris
pollution.<a href="#References">(Torres, 2020)</a> Firstly, the most common fuel type in rockets is Kerosene. <a href="#References">(Brown et al., 2024)</a> This is used in just under half of all rockets and can cause 
major damage to the environment as a result of its emission products; those being Carbon dioxide, water vapor and a small proportion of both black carbon and nitric
oxide. Both of the primary components of Kerosene emissions are harmful to the atmosphere by contributing to the effects of climate change. Consequently, wildlife can
be put in danger, for example polar bears as climate change can cause a heating effect; damaging their habitats and forcing them to adapt their lifestyle in order to 
survive the warmer weather. This  therefore shows how spacecraft can negatively affect ecosystems due to chemical pollution. Secondly, Debris pollution can cause
serious harm to earth due to the Kessler Syndrome <a href="#References">(Ramirez. D, 2024)</a>. This states that as more and more satellites are going into orbit due to the development of 
spacecraft, a chain reaction of collisions between one another is being recorded. An increase in small fragments of space debris can therefore be a point of danger not
only for the atmosphere. They will eventually re-enter and burn in the Earth’s atmosphere causing an increase in atmospheric pollution and therefore climate change.
This reiterates the dangers of the space industry on the environment as climate change irreversibly. Once again, this shows how the environment can be impacted
by pollution; in this case debris pollution. 

 

Economy 

There can be many major economic benefits of the space industry particularly in low-income countries (LIC). For example, French Guiana, which is an LIC, owns a space
base which is used by the European Space Agency (ESA). This development provides a huge number of job opportunities for the locals, meaning the rate of unemployment
opportunities. As well as this, over two fifths of the country’s taxes come from the space sector. This is therefore a benefit for society in French Guiana in order to
boost its economy due to a greater number of workers. As shown on the graph below, the GDP of French Guiana has over doubled in only 20 years. Starting at just under €2000
million in the year 2000 to over € 4500 million in the year 2022 <a href="#References">(Statista, 2024)</a>. This shows the extent to which a change in a country’s primary form of income, in
this case the space industry, can help a society economically.

  <pre id="Conclusion_InText">
  In conclusion, the development of spacecraft has been instrumental in understanding life from a different perspective with the use of the MAXI as well as other devices.
  Without the existence of spacecraft, no images would've been created and in effect, society would've never have found the reasoning behind pulsars. In addition, the
  advancements in the space industry have greatly improved the financial aspects of developing countries such as French Guiana which really helped the region progress.
  While there are many positives to spacecrafts, the serious chemical and debris pollutions have major negative impacts on the environment of, not only Earth, but its
  atmosphere as well. As technology increases and advancements in spacecraft accelerate, a balance must be met in order for scientific research to remain as sustainable
  as possible.
